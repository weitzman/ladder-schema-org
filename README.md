We will use the Schema.org [Person](http://schema.org/Person) type which is one of the schema.org types recognized by Google. You can see this recipe in action in the [Drupal schema.org module screencast](http://www.vimeo.com/29821887).

Background Information
================
schema.org is a collaboration of Google, Yahoo! and Bing to standardize the way structured data is added to web pages. The schema.org vocabulary includes descriptive terms for content like movies, people, organizations, events, locations, etc. The goal is "to improve the display of search results, making it easier for people to find the right web pages."
